# slicker
New theme for SickRage

This new theme is slightly inspired by the Plex web-interface.

As base i used the Dark Slick theme and changed almost everything

A lot has to be done before completion.
- A lot of files need to be removed (css + js)
- A lot of css lines in the current dark.css can be removed since those are not used anymore.
- A lot .tmpl files need to be placed inside ```<div class="show-container"></div>``` Take a look at a file that is done (i.e: history.tmpl)
- Tables need to be restyled. Preferably with a 80% transparant black background, no borders, a hover effect on rows and fontawesome icons with tooltip as actions.
- And a lot more...

## Changes compared to slick
- Removed the top navigation and replaced with sidebar panel
- Full page fanart backgrounds
- Completely restyled the show-details with new layout
- In show-details the show drop-down selection is underneath the show name. Clicking it will reveal the dropdown.
- Removed the static show info on the home page (underneath the posters). Placed that information inside a slide-in hover effect
- Added a new view to the homepage. Now CoverFlow is available (with poster reflections)
- And more...
